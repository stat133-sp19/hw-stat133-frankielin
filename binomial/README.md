# Overview
"binomial" is a minimal R package that allows one to calculate and manipulate data from binomial distributions.

bin_variable() creates a "binvar" object

bin_distribution() creates a "bindis" and "data.frame"

bin_cumulative() creates a "bincum" and "data.frame"

plot() method for "bindis", "bincum", and "binvar" objects. 

summary() method for "binvar" object


bin_mean() function for binomial mean calculation

bin_mode() function for binomial mode calculation

bin_varience() function for binomial varience calculation

bin_skewness() function for binomial skewness calculation

bin_kurtosis() function for binomial kurtosis calculation

# Motivation
This package has been developed in order to complete an assignment in Stat 133 and to show that I can actaully make a package (hopefully decently well). Not only that, but this packages serves to bundle a few useful attributes of a binomial distribution into a useable format. More importantly, it presents itself as a way to easily access and plot binimial distributions. 

# Installation
Install the development version from GitHub via the package "devtools"
Thiss can be installed from the author, Frankie Lin at "www.githib.com/frankielin/binomial" (hopefully it should be up there, if not it will be uploaded to the class repository.)

Description: This package puts together the core components to calculate the binomial distribution. Combining multiple functions circling around
    the binomial distribution. The Binomial distribution is perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete random variables. Within
    this package we implement functions to calculate both the standard and cumulative distributions for the binomial distribution. Moreso, the package 
    contains a few methods by which to produce plots and summaries for the distribution. This package simplified to process to extract and analyzing the 
    binomial distribution. In this package we have a variety of main functions. These functions include: binomial distribution, binomial cumulative, binomial 
    probability, etc. Ultimately, this package simplifies the usage of binomial functions for analysis.

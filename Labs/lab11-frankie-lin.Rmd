#1) Number of characters per tweet*
```{r}
data <-
  data %>%
  mutate(content = as.character(content),
         author = as.character(author))

#Count the number of characters
summary(nchar(x = data$content))

#Display the summary() of the vector obtained above.
summary(nchar(x = data$content))

#Likewise, graph a histogram of these counts. To plot the histogram, use a bin width of 5 units: 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, etc. In other words: the first bin involves tweets between 1 and 5 characters (inclusive), the second bin involves tweets containing between 6 and 10 characters (inclusive), and so on.
hist(nchar(x = data$content), breaks = seq(1,175, by = 5))

#Are there any tweets with 0 characters? (write a command that answers this question).
sum(nchar(x = data$content) == 0) > 0

#Are there any tweets with 1 character? If yes (write commands that answer these questions):
sum(nchar(x = data$content) == 1) > 0

#how many?
sum(nchar(x = data$content) == 1)

#what is their content?
data$content[(nchar(x = data$content) == 1)]

#what is their location (i.e. index or position)?
(1:length(data$content))[(nchar(x = data$content) == 1)]

#What is the tweet with the most characters (i.e. max length)? (write a command that answers these questions).
data$content[which.max(nchar(x = data$content))]

#the number of characters
nchar(x = data$content)[which.max(nchar(x = data$content))]

#display its content
data$content[which.max(nchar(x = data$content))]

#Display location
which.max(nchar(x = data$content))


```

#2) Author (usernames)*
```{r}
authorchar <- nchar(data$author)

# No longer than 15 characters (if you find usernames longer than 15 characters, display them)
which(authorchar > 15)

# Contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. If you find usernames containing other symbols, display them. Hint: The non-word character class is "\\W" is your friend.
data$author[str_detect(data$author, "\\W")]

# What is the number of characters of the shortest usernames? And what are the names of these authors? (write commands to answer these questions)
data$author[authorchar == min(authorchar)]

```

#3) Various Symbols and Strings*
```{r}
library(stringr)
#How many tweets contain at least one caret symbol "^" (write a command to answer this question).
sum(str_detect(data$content, "\\^"))

#How many tweets contain three or more consecutive dollar symbols "$" (write a command to answer this question).
sum(str_detect(data$content, "\\${3}"))

#How many tweets do NOT contain the characters "a" or "A" (write a command to answer this question).
sum(!str_detect(data$content, "[aA]"))

#Display the first 10 elements of the tweets that do NOT contain the characters "a" or "A" (write a command to answer this question).
head(data$content[!str_detect(data$content, "[aA]")], 5)

#Number of exclamation symbols "!": compute a vector with the number of exclamation symbols in each tweet, and display its summary().
exclaim_num <- str_count(data$content, "!")
summary(exclaim_num)

#Whatâ€™s the tweet (content) with the largest number of exclamation symbols !? Display its content. (write a command to answer this question)
data$content[which.max(exclaim_num)]
```

# 4) Sentiment*
```{r}
#What are the different types of sentiments (i.e. categories)? (write a command that answers this question)
unique(data$sentiment)

#Compute the frequencies (i.e. counts) of each sentiment (and display these frequencies).
table(data$sentiment)

#Graph the relative frequencies (i.e. proportions) with a horizontal barplot (bars horizontally oriented) in decreasing order, including names of sentiment types.

plot.dat <- 
  data %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  summarize(freq = n()/nrow(data))


ggplot(data = plot.dat, aes(x = reorder(sentiment, -freq), y = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip()
  

#Sentiment and length of tweets: compute a table with the average length of characters per sentiment (i.e. average number of characters for neutral tweets, for happy tweets, etc.). Display this table.
tab <- 
  data %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  summarize(average_char = mean(nchar(content)))

tab

```

#1) Your Turn*: Lab Directory
```{r eval = FALSE}
#Open (or launch) the command line
cd '/Users/Frankie/Documents/School/Stat 133/Labs/Lab 5/'

#Use the command pwd to see whatâ€™s your current directory
pwd

#Use mkdir to create a new directory stat133-lab05
mkdir stat133-lab05

#Change directory to stat133-lab05
cd stat133-lab05

#Use the command curl to download the following text file:
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/bread.txt

#Use the command ls to list the contents in your current directory
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/btaco.txt
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/1st_aid.txt
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/beesherb.txt
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/bakebred.txt


#Use the command curl to download these other text files:
curl -O http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/forestfires.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/cars.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/color.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/snow.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/mid1.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/mid2.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/minutes1.csv
curl -O http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/minutes2.csv

```

#2) Your Turn*: Inspecting a Directory
```{r eval = FALSE}
#Use the command ls to list the contents in your current directory
ls

#Now try ls -l to list the contents in your current directory in long format
ls -l

#Look at the man documentation of ls to find out how to list the contents in reverse order
ls -lr

#How would you list the contents in long format arranged by time?
ls - lt

#Find out how to use the wildcard * to list all the files with extension .txt
list -l grep *.txt

#Use the wildcard * to list all the files with extension .csv in reverse order
ls -l *.txt

#You can use the character ? to represent a single character: e.g. ls mid?.csv. Find out how to use the wilcard ? to list .csv files with names made of 4 characters (e.g. mid1.csv, snow.csv)
ls -l ????.csv

#The command ls *[1]*.csv should list .csv files with names containing the number 1 (e.g. mid1.csv, minutes1.csv). Adapt the command to list .csv files with names containing the number 2.
ls -l *[2]*.csv

#Find out how to list files with names containing any number.
ls -l *[0-9]*.csv

```

#3) Your Turn*: Moving Files
```{r eval = FALSE}
#Inside stat133-lab05 create a directory data
mkdir data

#Change directory to data
cd data

#Create a directory txt-files
mkdir txt-files

#Create a directory csv-files
mkdir csv-files

#Use the command mv to move the bread.txt file to the folder txt-files. Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that bread.txt is now inside txt-files.
mv ../bread.txt txt-files
ls txt-files

#Use the wildcard * to move all the .txt files to the directory txt-files. Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that all the .txt files are inside txt-files.
mv ../*.txt txt-files
ls txt-files

#Use the wildcard * to move all the .csv files to the directory csv-files. Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that all the .csv files are inside csv-files.
mv ../*.csv csv-files
ls csv-files

#Try using the command tree to see a visual display of the filestructure. Warning: You may not have this command in git-bash or in another shell flavor.
tree
```

#4) Your Turn*: Copying Files
```{r eval = FALSE}
#Go back to the parent directory stat133-lab05
cd '/Users/Frankie/Documents/School/Stat 133/Labs/Lab 5/stat133-lab05'

#Create a directory copies
mkdir copies

#Use the command cp to copy the bread.txt file (the one inside the folder txt-files) to the copies directory
cp ./data/txt-files/bread.txt ./copies

#Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that bread.txt is now inside copies.
ls copies

#Use the wildcard * to copy all the .txt files in the directory copies
cp ./data/txt-files/*.txt ./copies

#Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that all the .txt files is now inside copies.
ls copies

#Use the wildcard * to copy all the .csv files in the directory copies
cp ./data/csv-files/*.csv ./copies

#Try using the command tree to see a visual display of the filestructure.
tree 
```

#5) Your Turn*: Renaming and Deleting Files
```{r eval = FALSE}
#Change to the directory copies
cd copies

#Use the command mv to rename the file bread.txt as bread-recipe.txt
mv bread.txt bread-recipe.txt

#Rename the file cars.csv as autos.csv
mv cars.csv autos.csv

#Rename the file btaco.txt as breakfast-taco.txt
mv btaco.txt breakdast-taco.txt

#Change to the parent directory (i.e. stat133-lab05)
cd ../

#Rename the directory copies as copy-files
mv copies copy-files

#Find out how to use the rm command to delete the .csv files that are in copy-files
rm ./copy-files/*.csv

#Find out how to use the rm command to delete the directory copy-files
rm -r copy-files

#List the contents of the directory txt-files displaying the results in reverse (alphabetical) order
ls -r ./data/txt-files/

```

#Use ggplot() to make a scatterplot of mpg and disp, and store it in a ggplot object named gg_mpg_disp. Then use ggsave() to save the plot with dimensions (width x height) 7 x 5 inches, as scatterplot-mpg-disp.pdf.

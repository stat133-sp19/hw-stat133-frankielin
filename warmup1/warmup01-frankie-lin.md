##### Cosmopolitan Recipe

![](/Users/Frankie/Documents/School/Stat%20133/Warmup%2001/cosmo.jpg)

###### Ingredients

-   3 ounces (6 tablespoons) vodka, Citron or plain
-   1.5 ounces (3 tablespoons) Cointreau or Triple Sec
-   1.5 ounces (3 tablespoons) lime juice
-   3 ounces (6 tablespoons) cranberry or pomegranate juice
-   Ice

###### Tools

-   Martini glass
-   Cocktail shaker
-   Hawthorne Strainer

###### Instructions

1.  Chill glass in freezer till needed
2.  Place ingredients and ice in a cocktail shaker
3.  Shake until everything is cold
4.  Strain drink into chilled glass and serve
5.  Garnish with lime or lemon peel

###### Comments

-   Orginiated from the 1930s
-   Popularized by *Sex and the City*
-   Originally included cranberry juice, modern iterations utilize pomegrante juice
-   Other variations include stirring in a mixing glass, rather than shaking

Eucledian Distance
------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q**, is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\mathbf{p}\\mathbf{q}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **p** to **q** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
d(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{qp}) = {\\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + {...} + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}}
$$
$$
=\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i - p\_i)^2  }
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
\\left\\|{\\mathbf  {p}}\\right\\|={\\sqrt  {p\_{1}^{2}+p\_{2}^{2}+\\cdots +p\_{n}^{2}}}={\\sqrt  {{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot {\\mathbf{p}}}},
$$

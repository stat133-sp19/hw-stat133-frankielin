#Project Description

On this project, the goal was to understand and create a Shiny application where we were able to modify variables for three different investment strategies. In essence, we sought to design an application that could project future savings. This application contains modifiable variables. We modelled the total savings off three different investment strategies: single time contribution, fixed contribution, and growing contribution.
